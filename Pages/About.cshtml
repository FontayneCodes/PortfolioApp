        <p>
            I’m a self-taught turned college-certified software developer, single mom, and full-stack problem solver.
            I’ve built real apps for real people while juggling life, kids, and code — and I bring all that drive to the keyboard.
        </p>

        <p>
            From designing beautiful, functional websites to building backend systems in C# and Razor Pages, I love turning
            bold ideas into digital experiences that actually work.
